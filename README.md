# Image-Caption-Generator
The objective of the project is to predict the captions for the input image from a dataset which consists of 8k images with 5 captions per image. The features are extracted from both the image and the text captions for input. The features will be concatenated to predict the next word of the caption. CNN is used for image and LSTM is used for text. The performance of the model is evaluated using BLEU Score.
